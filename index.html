                "The thing to finally bring humanity to its knees hadn't been climate change nor nuclear war, it had been far simpler than that.
                It all started with a single cough.
                <br>
                <br>
                Project Clean Up was one of necessity: to give proper burial to the many lives lost and reclaim land from the sickness.
                <br>
                <br>
                Akim Valenka, a strapping young man in his late 20s, had finally graduated from training and joined Clean Up's ranks as a green scout. He could finally fulfill his dream to help reclaim his family's hometown from the horror and death that permeated the land, and perhaps one day, move back to their roots.
                He may have been born in the Golden City, but many nights in his youth listening to his father's stories had lit something deep inside his chest.
                <br>
                <br>
                One thing he hadn't expected however... was the discovery that people still lived out there among the abandoned farmland and Sandhills to this day, somehow, surviving without support from the rest of the world.
                <br>
                <br>
                His first and last mistake was trusting them."

                        <b>Vanilla Milkshake</b> (commonly abbreviated to VM) is a transformed

                        were an individual who became infected with The Roots virus, and 
                        in an attempt to save himself, he volunteered as the first subject 
                        of Green Ichor, <b>Gran’s</b> vaccine/cure. After knowingly risking and ultimately 
                        infecting the other human employees of <b>Antihuman Inc</b>, VM came out of the procedure 
                        as a failed test subjects due to his very poor mental condition post-transmutation, 
                        caused by his later stage of Roots. Lavender flowers have shown up in both music 
                        videos that VM has appeared in.
